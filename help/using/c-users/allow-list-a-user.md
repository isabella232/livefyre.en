# Allow-list a User{#allow-list-a-user}

Allow-list a user to allow them to post directly to Apps without being moderatated.

Allow-listing Users allows them to post directly to your Apps. Content posted by allow-listed users will not pass through Livefyre’s SAFE, profanity, or premoderation filters, and will be automatically approved and added to the App.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL +Add]** for **[!UICONTROL Whitelists]**.
1. A popup will appear that allows you to allow-list the user for the entire network, or for a specific site. (Use the CTR or Command key to select multiple sites.)
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Whitelist]** to complete the process.
