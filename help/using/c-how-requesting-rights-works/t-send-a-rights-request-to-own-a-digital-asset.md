# Send a Twitter Rights Request{#send-a-twitter-rights-request}

You can request the right to reuse the item for your commercial purposes from the Library, App Content, or ModQ.

 Before you can send a rights request you must:

* Add a Twitter social account. For more information on how to configure a social account, see [Add a Social Account](../c-users-creating-accounts-with-studio-access/t-configure-social-accout-instagram/t-configure-social-accout-instagram.md#t_configure_social_accout_instagram).
* Set up Rights Management. For more information on how to set up rights management, see [Requesting Rights](../c-how-requesting-rights-works/c-how-requesting-rights-works.md#c_how_requesting_rights_works).

You can send rights requests from the Library, App Content, or the ModQ. In the Library and in App Content, you must save a Twitter asset before you can request rights for that asset. Click on the details for an asset to request rights.

For ModQ, you can request rights by clicking **[!UICONTROL More Details]** on a Twitter asset.

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Rights options]** window.
1. Select the account to use to request rights.
1. (Optional) Edit the request message. If the message is missing an element or a required element is misspelled, an error message displays that specifies the incorrect or missing information.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Send]** to send the request to the owner of the content.
