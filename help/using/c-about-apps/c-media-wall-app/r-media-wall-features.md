The Media Wall app offers these features for your site.



* Displays content in order based on the date it was published (not on the date the content was created).
* Combines both Livefyre and social media content in a single display.
* Allows users to like content, and to add text or photos directly to your Media Wall.
* Allows your users to share content to Twitter and Facebook. The shared permalink will redirect those who click it back to the piece of content on your Media Wall.
* Allows you to create special styling for Featured Content.
