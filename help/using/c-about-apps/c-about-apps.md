Studio provides easy access to your Apps, allowing you to search, edit, and manage custom Apps from a single page.

The bottom of the Style and Configuration pane lists the Livefyre App version for your App. If a newer version of the codebase for the App exists, an **[!UICONTROL Update]** button displays. Click the button to update to the newest release version, and refresh your App with all available feature enhancements and bug fixes. Once updated, preview changes made to your App (if any), then accept or reject the update.

Use Apps to quickly build and deploy engaging Apps powered by social content. Using simple design and configuration controls, Apps allow you to easily create and update Apps targeted for your audience.

Use the Apps tab to create new Apps, define their settings, and embed them on your site.
