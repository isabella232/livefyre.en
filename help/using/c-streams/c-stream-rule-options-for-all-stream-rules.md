# Stream Rule Options for All Stream Rules{#stream-rule-options-for-all-stream-rules}

These options apply for any stream rules from all social networks or posting methods.

Search features for text and keyword fields:

* When you enter keywords, Livefyre automatically uses the Boolean operator **OR** when for individual words. For example, to search for posts with either the word *cake* or *recipe*, enter *cake*, then enter *recipe* in the **[!UICONTROL keyword]** field. 

* You can search for exact phrases by surrounding the exact phrase text in quotes. For example, to search for the exact phrase *cake recipe*, enter *"cake recipe"* in the **[!UICONTROL keyword]** field. 

* You can combine the Boolean and exact phrase searches in one stream rule. For example, you can search for *cake*, *recipe*, and *"cake recipe"* by entering each phrase one at a time.

**[!UICONTROL Additional Filters]**:

* **[!UICONTROL Media]**. Select one of the following:

    * **[!UICONTROL All Content.]** Allow any content. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Media Required.]** Allow only content with images and videos. (For Instagram and Facebook content, you can specify **[!UICONTROL Photos]** or **[!UICONTROL Videos]** only).

* **[!UICONTROL Language]**. Choose the language to search in. English is the default language. 
* **[!UICONTROL Smart Tags]**. Choose the tags to use to identify content. Livefyre uses computer vision technology to identify photos and videos with specific smart tags to make this search more precise. Use the **[!UICONTROL ANY]** modifier to filter content into the stream using any tag or the **[!UICONTROL ALL]** modifier to filter content into the stream that uses all tags. Use the **[!UICONTROL Image contains none of these smart tags]** field to enter tags for photos containing content you do not want in the stream. This option does not work for text content. 

* **[!UICONTROL Products]**. Add product tags to match the stream rule with products from your product catalog. 
* **[!UICONTROL Premoderate]**. Select one of the following:

    * **[!UICONTROL On]**. Premoderate all incoming rule content. You can view premoderated content from the Streams section of ModQ. **[!UICONTROL On]** overrides the settings in App Settings. 
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Off]**. Do not premoderate any incoming rule content. **[!UICONTROL Off]** overrides the settings in App Settings. 
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Inherited (Off)]**. Use the premoderate settings from the site (under **[!UICONTROL Site Settings]**).

* **[!UICONTROL SAFE Rules]**. Select one of the following:

    * **[!UICONTROL Apply SAFE Rules]**. Apply all SAFE Rules to this stream. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Apply SAFE Rules for:]** Select one or more of the options to apply SAFE Rules for this stream rule. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Disable SAFE Rules]**. Do not apply any SAFE Rules to this stream.
