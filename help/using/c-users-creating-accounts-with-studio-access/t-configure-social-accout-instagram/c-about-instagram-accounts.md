Learn the rules and requirements for Instagram that are different than other social accounts.

You must configure an *Instagram business account* to:

* Perform an Instagram social search by user (user must be an Instagram business account).
* Create Instagram streams from a specific Instagram user account (the account must be a business account).
* Request rights for assets from Instagram using a partially-automated workflow
