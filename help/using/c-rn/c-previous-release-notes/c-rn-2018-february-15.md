Release Notes for the February 15, 2018 release.

## New Features {#section_syx_mdt_wcb}

The following features are new in the production version of this release:

* **Smart Tags.**

  Livefyre uses Adobe Sensei image-recognition technology to automatically tag images you save in the library.
  With Smart Tags you can save a significant amount of time searching and moderating content. With Smart Tags, you can:

  * Search saved images for precise content based on the image content, rather than only text
  * Collect content in streams based on precise search terms that analyze the image, rather than only text

  For more information about Smart Tags, see [Smart Tags](../../c-features-livefyre/c-smart-tags/c-smart-tags.md#c_smart_tags).

* **In-product messages.** Now when you log in to Livefyre Studio, an announcements window pops up to display updates about new features. 
* **UGC for Carousel.** You can now use all the functions of UGC Commerce in the Livefyre Carousel App. You can create a Call-to-Action Button and connect your product catalog to the App to create a shoppable experience from Carousel.
