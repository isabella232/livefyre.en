# App Implementation {#appimplementation}

Use Case: As a customer, I want to integrate Livefyre into my 3rd party CMS using the Livefyre.js method.

There are three ways to implement Livefyre in to a custom AEM component or other CMS' like WordPress, Sitecore, or DemandWare: Designer App Implementation, API, Implementation, and Third Party Authentication Integration.

## Designer App Implementation {#designerapp}

What: Simplest and fastest way of integrating a Livefyre App. You can design, configure, and generate a customized Javascript embed code to integrate a Liveyfre App on a page in minutes.

How: [Create, Preview, Publish, and Embed a Livefyre App](/help/using/c-about-apps/c-create-an-app.md)

Example: [https://codepen.io/dharafyre/pen/bvGrLo](https://codepen.io/dharafyre/pen/bvGrLo)

### Livefyre.js Implementation {#livefyrejsimp}

What: [Livefyre.js](/help/implementation/c-livefyre.js.md) is the core library that powers Apps and Auth on a site. It defines the global `window.Livefyre` object and a single public method, Livefyre.require, which can be used to load other Livefyre JavaScript libraries that help with embedding Livefyre Apps and integrating with third party User Auth platforms.

How:

* [Create a Collection Using the CollectionMeta Token](/help/implementation/t-create-a-collectionmeta-token.md)

* Integrate Apps into third party CMS using App Integrations

Examples:

* Comments App: [https://codepen.io/dharafyre/pen/oYoJdP](https://codepen.io/dharafyre/pen/oYoJdP)

* Reviews App: [https://codepen.io/dharafyre/pen/GXgvvd](https://codepen.io/dharafyre/pen/GXgvvd)

* Media Wall: [https://codepen.io/dharafyre/pen/dNMPvM](https://codepen.io/dharafyre/pen/dNMPvM)

* For advanced customizations using the SDK, see StreamHub SDKs.

## API Implementation {#apiimplementation}

For creating customized experiences and data visualizations, Livefyre Apps can be created from scratch by consuming Livefyre and social data using the Bootstrap and Stream API.

## Third Party Authentication Integration {#thirdpartyauth}

For Livefyre Apps requiring authentication, see [Identity Integration](/help/implementation/t-about-identity-integration/t-about-identity-integration.md) for third party authentication platforms.

## Customer Examples {#customerexamples}

The following customers implemented Livefyre with Third Party CMS Integrations:

* [TimeOut](https://www.timeout.com/london/restaurants/forest-bar-kitchen#tab_panel_3)
