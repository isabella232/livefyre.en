Options may be defined for Comments, Live Blog, Reviews, Sidenotes, the Comment Notifier, archived comments, and pre-defined user groups.

* Available CSS Classes allow you to change div elements, sort options, bounding boxes, icons, and other display options for your Apps.
* [Localize Strings](/help/using/c-settings-other/c-translation-sets/c-localize-strings.md) to set the language and tone for your Apps.
* Specify the Date/Time Format to conform to your style.
* Move the Livefyre Logo to display it less conspicuously on your App.
* Restrict Media to prevent users from uploading specified media embed types.
* Hide App Elements to simplify your user experience.
