Use this library to integrate Livefyre services into your native Android app. The [Livefyre StreamHub Android SDK](https://github.com/Livefyre/StreamHub-Android-SDK) provides a thin layer around our common API mechanisms, based on the Gradle/Android Studio development environment.

Livefyre also provides a [Reviews](https://github.com/Livefyre/StreamHub-iOS-Reviews-App) sample App, based on this SDK.

This Livefyre Android SDK can be used in both Eclipse and Android Studio.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Before installing the Livefyre Android SDK you must have the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) installed on your environment. You must also include some additional Android SDK packages, as described in the Android Developer docs > .
>[Adding SDK Packages](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html)

Use the Android SDK Manager (available from the Android Studio or Eclipse toolbar) to install all recommended packages. Be certain to also include the Android Support Repository.
