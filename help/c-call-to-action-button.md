## Custom Call-to-Action Button {#topic_EBE23A0F827645E0A0C619DCF3872EE5}

Custom Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons are buttons that can be added to any asset in Livefyre Studio to make the content actionable. They can refer an end-user to any customized URL, such as a social media page or a shopping cart. CTA buttons can be created in multiple locations in Livefyre, but they are managed within the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** section of Livefyre Studio.

With Custom CTAs, you can:

* Add custom CTA buttons to any piece of UGC in your Livefyre media walls, mosaics, carousels, film strips, and on individual feature cards. 
* Have control over the message, icons, colors, links, and number of buttons on each piece of UGC. 
* Create, manage, and repurpose custom CTA buttons from within Settings and the Library. 
* Use Adobe Analytics to measure click-through rates.
